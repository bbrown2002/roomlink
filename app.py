RoomLink connects students with verified off-campus housing options in Winston-Salem. It streamlines the entire process through:

1. **Housing Listings**  
   View submitted listings from students and local property owners. Filter by location, rent range, lease length, and housing rules like pets or smoking.

2. **School-Affiliated Access**  
   Access is limited to verified students to keep listings clean, honest, and useful.

More features are being built to support profile verification, communication tools, and neighborhood safety insights.
