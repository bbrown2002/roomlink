st.markdown("""
RoomLink is a modern, student-centered web application designed to help users find safe, affordable off-campus housing and connect with compatible roommates. It addresses the most common pain points students face ‚Äî limited verified listings, unreliable roommate sources, and no centralized way to filter based on lifestyle or budget.

Unlike outdated rental boards or sketchy group chats, RoomLink combines clean design with smart logic to make off-campus housing less stressful and more strategic.

### üß† Why RoomLink?

- **For Students, By Students**: Every feature is tailored toward the student lifestyle ‚Äî from flexible lease filters to roommate matching by sleep schedule.
- **Verified Housing Data**: Listings include rent, rules, distance, and more ‚Äî structured in a way that‚Äôs easy to compare.
- **Lifestyle-Based Matching**: Instead of random pairings, RoomLink learns your habits and matches you with roommates you‚Äôll actually get along with.
- **Simple, Secure, and Scalable**: This version is a fully functioning prototype built using Streamlit and Python, but the structure supports future growth with messaging, verification, and school email sign-on.

    Any user can submit available housing using a simple form that collects:
    - Property address
    - Rent amount
    - Lease type and terms
    - Pet/smoking policies
    - Optional image links or notes

    All data is displayed on a clean listings page so students can browse and filter options easily.

    Our match form collects detailed lifestyle information:

    - Cleanliness rating
    - Social habits and guest policy
    - Preferred noise level, pets, smoking

    Users are matched based on overlapping preferences, not just availability.

st.markdown("""
RoomLink was designed to be scalable, fast, and accessible to anyone. The current build uses:

- **Streamlit**: To create a clean Python-powered UI with instant deployment.
- **GitHub**: For version control, project structure, and collaboration.
- **Google Forms/Sheets (optional)**: For mock backend data storage if needed.
- **RandomUser API**: To simulate real-world profiles without privacy concerns.
- **Python**: For all data handling, user logic, and future backend compatibility.

The project is hosted publicly on GitHub and deployable through Streamlit Cloud for real-time access.

st.markdown("""
RoomLink is designed to grow beyond a prototype. The structure supports features that could turn it into a full SaaS platform for student housing, including:

- üîê **School Email Verification**: Limit access to verified students only.
- üí¨ **Built-in Messaging**: Let users connect through the app once matched.
- üßæ **Contract Assistance**: Auto-generate lease templates or agreement forms.
- üîé **Advanced Filtering**: Add map views, ratings, and affordability calculators.
- üì≤ **Mobile Optimization**: Convert to PWA or mobile-first layout with responsive design.
